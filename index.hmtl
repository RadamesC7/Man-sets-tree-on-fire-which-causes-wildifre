    In this Clay animation a man was trying to make smores and a fire partcel got caught onto a tree, the tree starting sparking with fire partcles and then started to catch on fire. This started to spread to the other trees, the other trees also started to spark with the flame particles catching on to the tree on starting to get catch on fires, then it because a full on forrest fire and just burning down the whole forrest.
      
     What we did for our anamtion was I was cutting out the paper for out anamation with nachai, Micheal and Justin were making the clay and anamating the scene, and miceheal was working on the camrea. 
      How we made our anamtion was out of clay and the colored paper for the trees and the wood to make the outer scences.
